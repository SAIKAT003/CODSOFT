          These words were uttered by the lion-hearted freedom fighter and
          patriot who had roared out loud in the Japanese jungles, "Give me
          blood and I will give you freedom”. Yes, I’m talking about Netaji
          Subhas Chandra Bose a flower whose fragrance made independence more
          sweet and whose thorns scared the living lights out of the British.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the nation pays tributes to this great leader on the occasion of
          his 125th birth anniversary it is appropriate to revisit the life,
          philosophy and sacrifice of Netaji.

          He was born in Cuttack after four decades of the unforgettable robust
          sepoy mutiny of 1857 when the British rule was at its prime and India
          and Indians were struggling to maintain their self esteem.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a child Netaji was a great academic success and was selected for
          the prestigious ICS in early 20th century when very few Indians could
          get into the prestigious civil services. Now this is what we call an
          irony in a person's life, patriotic Bose could not work under the
          British yoke, it seemed proposterous to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “ No real change in history has been achieved by discussions”, these
          words of Netaji were proven by his own action of resigning from the
          post off an ICS and signing as a member of Indian National Congress.
        </p>

          As a leader totally focussed on getting freedom for his country, Bose
          was not averse to following the path of armed conflict to oust the
          British from his country. The British government was unable to
          browbeat him by arresting him as he managed to escape swiftly and went
          to Germany and later to Japan to get international support for his
          fight against the British.
        </p>
        <p>
          He made an army of about 30,000 soldiers in Germany itself, he was
          supplemented with troops from the Indian prisoners of war. However, it
          was in Japan that Ras bihari Bose gave Subhash the command of the
          Indian National Army. A major advancement made by the INA under the
          leadership of Netaji was the declaration of Arzi
          Hukumat-e-Azad.However, his sudden death in an air accident left his
          dream of seeing an independent India during his lifetime unfulfilled.
          But his contribution to the struggle for India's freedom and his role
          in bringing international focus on the plight of our country can never
          be forgotten.

          Netaji was a true nationalist and patriot who adopted a different
          route to get freedom for his country and as his "methods" were
          different from those of the leaders like Mahatma Gandhi , JL Nehru and
          others, it is generally believed that he had no love lost for them.
          Thus the bond shared by two staunch nationalists that is Mahatma
          Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose is generally ignored. Mahatma Gandhi
          is known as the father of the nation but do we know who gave him this
          title? Yes ,it was Netaji. This shows the rare respect he had for the
          Mahatma.
